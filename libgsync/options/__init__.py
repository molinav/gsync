"""
Defines the singleton interface to gsync command line options.

This requires some explaining.  The point of this metaclass excercise is to
create a static abstract class that is in one way or another, dormant until
queried.  I experimented with creating a singlton on import, but that did
not quite behave how I wanted it to.  See now here, we are creating a class
called GsyncOptions, that on import, will do nothing except state that its
class creator is GsyncOptionsType.  This means, docopt doesn't parse any
of the help document, nor does it start processing command line options.
So importing this module becomes really efficient.  The complicated bit
comes from requiring the GsyncOptions class to be static.  By that, I mean
any property on it, may or may not exist, since they are not statically
defined; so I can't simply just define the class with a whole bunch of
properties that are @property @staticmethods.

So here's how it works:

Executing 'from libgsync.options import GsyncOptions' does nothing more
than load up this module, define the Type and the Class and import them
into the callers namespace.  Simple.

Invoking 'GsyncOptions.debug' for the first time, or any other property
causes the __metaclass__ __getattr__ method to be called, since the class
is not instantiated as a class instance yet.  The __getattr__ method on
the type then initialises the class (GsyncOptions) via the __initialise_class
method.  This is the first and only time the class will actually have its
dictionary statically populated.  The docopt module is invoked to parse the
usage document and generate command line options from it.  These are then
paired with their defaults and what's in sys.argv.  After all that, we
setup some dynamic properties that could not be defined by their name in
the usage, before everything is then transplanted onto the actual class
object (or static class GsyncOptions).

Another piece of magic, is to allow command line options to be set in
in their native form and be translated into argparse style properties.

Finally, the GsyncListOptions class is actually where the options are
stored.  This only acts as a mechanism for storing options as lists, to
allow aggregation of duplicate options or options that can be specified
multiple times.  The __getattr__ call hides this by default, returning the
last item in a property's list.  However, if the entire list is required,
calling the 'list()' method on the GsyncOptions class, returns a reference
to the GsyncListOptions class, which contains all of the same properties
but as lists and without the duplication of having them as both lists and
static singlton values.

So this actually means that GsyncOptions is actually a static proxy class...
